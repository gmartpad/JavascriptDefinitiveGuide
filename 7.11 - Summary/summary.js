/*
 * This chapter has covered JavaScript arrays in depth, including esoteric
 * details about sparse arrays and array-like objects. The main points to
 * take from this chapter are:
 * 
 *      - Array literals are written as comma-separated lists of values
 *      within square brackets.
 *      
 *      - Individual array elements are accessed by specifying the
 *      desired array index within square brackets.
 * 
 *      - The for/of loop and ... spread operator introduced in ES6
 *      are particularly useful ways to iterate arrays.
 * 
 *      - The Array class defines a rich set of methods for manipulating
 *      arrays, and you should be sure to familiarize yourself with the
 *      Array API.
