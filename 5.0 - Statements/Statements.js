/*
 * By that
 * analogy, statements are JavaScript sentences or commands. Just as
 * English sentences are terminated and separated from one another with
 * periods, JavaScript statements are terminated with semicolons.
 * Expressions are evaluated to produce a value, but statements are
 * executed to make something happen
 *
 * One way to “make something happen” is to evaluate an expression that
 * has side effects. Expressions with side effects, such as assignments and
 * function invocations, can stand alone as statements, and when used this
 * way are known as expression statements. A similar category of
 * statements are the declaration statements that declare new variables
 * and define new functions.
 * 
 * JavaScript programs are nothing more than a sequence of statements to
 * execute. By default, the JavaScript interpreter executes these
 * statements one after another in the order they are written. Another way
 * to “make something happen” is to alter this default order of execution,
 * and JavaScript has a number of statements or control structures that do
 * just this:
 * 
 * Conditionals
 *      Statements like if and switch that make the JavaScript
 *      interpreter execute or skip other statements depending on the value
 *      of an expression
 * 
 * Loops
 *      Statements like while and for that execute other statements
 *      repetitively
 * 
 * Jumps
 *      Statements like break, return, and throw that cause the
 *      interpreter to jump to another part of the program
 * 
 * The sections that follow describe the various statements in JavaScript
 * and explain their syntax. Table 5-1, at the end of the chapter,
 * summarizes the syntax. A JavaScript program is simply a sequence of
 * statements, separated from one another with semicolons, so once you
 * are familiar with the statements of JavaScript, you can begin writing
 * JavaScript programs.
