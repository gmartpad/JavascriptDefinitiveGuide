/*
 * A common operation in JavaScript programs is needing to copy the
 * properties of one object to another object. It is easy to do that with code
 * like this:
 */

let target = {x: 1}, source = {y: 2, z: 3};
for(let key of Object.keys(source)) {
    target[key] = source[key];
}
target // => {x: 1, y: 2, z: 3}

/*
 * But because this is a common operation, various JavaScript
 * frameworks have defined utility functions, often named extend(), to
 * perform this copying operation. Finally, in ES6, this ability comes to
 * the core JavaScript language in the form of Object.assign().
 * Object.assign() expects two or more objects as its arguments. It
 * modifies and returns the first argument, which is the target object, but
 * does not alter the second or any subsequent arguments, which are the
 * source objects. For each source object, it copies the enumerable own
 * properties of that object (including those whose names are Symbols)
 * into the target object. It processes the source objects in argument list
 * order so that properties in the first source object override properties by
 * the same name in the target object and properties in the second source
 * object (if there is one) override properties with the same name in the
 * first source object.
 * 
 * Object.assign() copies properties with ordinary property get and
 * set operations, so if a source object has a getter method or the target
 * object has a setter method, they will be invoked during the copy, but
 * they will not themselves be copied.
 * 
 * One reason to assign properties from one object into another is when
 * you have an object that defines default values for many properties and
 * you want to copy those default properties into another object if a
 * property by that name does not already exist in that object. Using
 * Object.assign() naively will not do what you want:
 */

Object.assign(o, defaults); // overwrites everything in o with defaults

/*
 * Instead, what you can do is to create a new object, copy the defaults
 * into it, and then override those defaults with the properties in o:
 */

o = Object.assign({}, defaults, o);

/*
 * Weâ€™ll see that you can also express this object copy-andoverride operation using the ... spread operator like this:
 */

o = {...defaults, ...o};

/*
 * We could also avoid the overhead of the extra object creation and
 * copying by writing a version of Object.assign() that copies
 * properties only if they are missing:
 */

// Like Object.assign() but doesn't override existing properties
// (and also doesn't handle Symbol properties)

function merge(target, ...sources) {
    for(let source of sources) {
        for(let key of Object.keys(source)) {
            if (!(key in target)) { // This is different than Object.assign()
                target[key] = source[key];
            }
        }
    }
    return target;
}

Object.assign({x: 1}, {x: 2, y: 2}, {y: 3, z: 4}) // => {x: 2, y: 3, z: 4}
merge({x: 1}, {x: 2, y: 2}, {y: 3, z: 4}) // => {x: 1, y: 2, z: 4}

/*
 * It is straightforward to write other property manipulation utilities like
 * this merge() function. A restrict() function could delete
 * properties of an object if they do not appear in another template object,
 * for example. Or a subtract() function could remove all of the
 * properties of one object from another object.
