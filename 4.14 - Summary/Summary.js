/*
 * This chapter covers a wide variety of topics, and there is lots of
 * reference material here that you may want to reread in the future as you
 * continue to learn JavaScript. Some key points to remember, however,
 * are these:
 *
 *      - Expressions are the phrases of a JavaScript program.
 *      
 *      - Any expression can be evaluated to a JavaScript value.
 *      
 *      - Expressions can also have side effects (such as variable
 *      assignment) in addition to producing a value.
 *      
 *      - Simple expressions such as literals, variable references, and
 *      property accesses can be combined with operators to produce
 *      larger expressions.
 *      
 *      - JavaScript defines operators for arithmetic, comparisons,
 *      Boolean logic, assignment, and bit manipulation, along with
 *      some miscellaneous operators, including the ternary
 *      conditional operator.
 *      
 *      - The JavaScript + operator is used to both add numbers and
 *      concatenate strings.
 *      
 *      - The logical operators && and || have special “shortcircuiting” 
 *      behavior and sometimes only evaluate one of their
 *      arguments. Common JavaScript idioms require you to
 *      understand the special behavior of these operators.
