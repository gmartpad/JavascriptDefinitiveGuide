/*
 * Conditional statements execute or skip other statements depending on
 * the value of a specified expression. These statements are the decision
 * points of your code, and they are also sometimes known as “branches.”
 * If you imagine a JavaScript interpreter following a path through your
 * code, the conditional statements are the places where the code branches
 * into two or more paths and the interpreter must choose which path to
 * follow.
 * 
 * The following subsections explain JavaScript’s basic conditional, the
 * if/else statement, and also cover switch, a more complicated,
 * multiway branch statement.
