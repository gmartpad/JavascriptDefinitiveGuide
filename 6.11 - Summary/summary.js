/*
 * This chapter has documented JavaScript objects in great detail,
 * covering topics that include:
 * 
 *      - Basic object terminology, including the meaning of terms like
 *      enumerable and own property.
 * 
 *      - Object literal syntax, including the many new features in ES6
 *      and later.
 * 
 *      - How to read, write, delete, enumerate, and check for the
 *      presence of the properties of an object.
 * 
 *      - How prototype-based inheritance works in JavaScript and how
 *      to create an object that inherits from another object with
 *      Object.create().
 * 
 *      - How to copy properties from one object into another with
 *      Object.assign().
 * 
 *      - All JavaScript values that are not primitive values are objects. This
 *      includes both arrays and functions, which are the topics of the next two
 *      chapters.
