/*
 * This chapter covers JavaScript functions. Functions are a fundamental
 * building block for JavaScript programs and a common feature in
 * almost all programming languages. You may already be familiar with
 * the concept of a function under a name such as subroutine or
 * procedure.
 * 
 * A function is a block of JavaScript code that is defined once but may
 * be executed, or invoked, any number of times. JavaScript functions are
 * parameterized: a function definition may include a list of identifiers,
 * known as parameters, that work as local variables for the body of the
 * function. Function invocations provide values, or arguments, for the
 * function’s parameters. Functions often use their argument values to
 * compute a return value that becomes the value of the functioninvocation expression. In addition to the arguments, each invocation
 * has another value—the invocation context—that is the value of the
 * this keyword.
 * 
 * If a function is assigned to a property of an object, it is known as a
 * method of that object. When a function is invoked on or through an
 * object, that object is the invocation context or this value for the
 * function. Functions designed to initialize a newly created object are
 * called constructors. 
 * 
 * In JavaScript, functions are objects, and they can be manipulated by
 * programs. JavaScript can assign functions to variables and pass them to
 * other functions, for example. Since functions are objects, you can set
 * properties on them and even invoke methods on them.
 * 
 * JavaScript function definitions can be nested within other functions,
 * and they have access to any variables that are in scope where they are
 * defined. This means that JavaScript functions are closures, and it
 * enables important and powerful programming techniques.
