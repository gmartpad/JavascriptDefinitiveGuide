/*
 * Objects are JavaScriptâ€™s most fundamental datatype, and you have
 * already seen them many times in the chapters that precede this one.
 * Because objects are so important to the JavaScript language, it is
 * important that you understand how they work in detail, and this chapter
 * provides that detail. It begins with a formal overview of objects, then
 * dives into practical sections about creating objects and querying,
 * setting, deleting, testing, and enumerating the properties of objects.
 * These property-focused sections are followed by sections that explain
 * how to extend, serialize, and define important methods on objects.
 * Finally, the chapter concludes with a long section about new object
 * literal syntax in ES6 and more recent versions of the language.
