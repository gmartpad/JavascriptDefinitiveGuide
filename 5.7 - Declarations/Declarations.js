/* 
 * The keywords const, let, var, function, class, import, and
 * export are not technically statements, but they look a lot like
 * statements, and this book refers informally to them as statements, so
 * they deserve a mention in this chapter.
 * 
 * These keywords are more accurately described as declarations rather
 * than statements. We said at the start of this chapter that statements
 * “make something happen.” Declarations serve to define new values
 * and give them names that we can use to refer to those values. They
 * don’t make much happen themselves, but by providing names for
 * values they, in an important sense, define the meaning of the other
 * statements in your program.
 * 
 * When a program runs, it is the program’s expressions that are being
 * evaluated and the program’s statements that are being executed. The
 * declarations in a program don’t “run” in the same way: instead, they
 * define the structure of the program itself. Loosely, you can think of
 * declarations as the parts of the program that are processed before the
 * code starts running.
 * 
 * JavaScript declarations are used to define constants, variables,
 * functions, and classes and for importing and exporting values between
 * modules. The next subsections give examples of all of these
 * declarations.
