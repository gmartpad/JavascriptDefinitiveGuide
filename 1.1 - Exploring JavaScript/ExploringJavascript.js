/*
 * When learning a new programming language, itâ€™s important to try the
 * examples in the book, then modify them and try them again to test your
 * understanding of the language. To do that, you need a JavaScript
 * interpreter.
 * 
 * The easiest way to try out a few lines of JavaScript is to open up the
 * web developer tools in your web browser (with F12, Ctrl-Shift-I, or
 * Command-Option-I) and select the Console tab. You can then type
 * code at the prompt and see the results as you type. Browser developer
 * tools often appear as panes at the bottom or right of the browser
 * window, but you can usually detach them as separate windows, 
 * which is often quite convenient.
 * 
 * Another way to try out JavaScript code is to download and install Node
from https://nodejs.org. Once Node is installed on your system, you
can simply open a Terminal window and type node to begin an
interactive JavaScript session like this one:
