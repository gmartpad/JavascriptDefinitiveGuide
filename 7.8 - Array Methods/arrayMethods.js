/*
 * The preceding sections have focused on basic JavaScript syntax for
 * working with arrays. In general, though, it is the methods defined by
 * the Array class that are the most powerful. The next sections document
 * these methods. While reading about these methods, keep in mind that
 * some of them modify the array they are called on and some of them
 * leave the array unchanged. A number of the methods return an array:
 * sometimes, this is a new array, and the original is unchanged. Other
 * times, a method will modify the array in place and will also return a
 * reference to the modified array.
 * 
 * Each of the subsections that follows covers a group of related array
 * methods:
 * 
 *      - Iterator methods loop over the elements of an array, typically
 *      invoking a function that you specify on each of those
 *      elements.
 * 
 *      - Stack and queue methods add and remove array elements to
 *      and from the beginning and the end of an array.
 * 
 *      - Subarray methods are for extracting, deleting, inserting,
 *      filling, and copying contiguous regions of a larger array.
 * 
 *      - Searching and sorting methods are for locating elements
 *      within an array and for sorting the elements of an array
 *
 * The following subsections also cover the static methods of the Array
 * class and a few miscellaneous methods for concatenating arrays and
 * converting arrays to strings.
