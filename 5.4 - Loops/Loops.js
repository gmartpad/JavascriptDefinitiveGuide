/* 
 * To understand conditional statements, we imagined the JavaScript
 * interpreter following a branching path through your source code. The
 * looping statements are those that bend that path back upon itself to
 * repeat portions of your code. JavaScript has five looping statements:
 * while, do/while, for, for/of (and its for/await variant),
 * and for/in. The following subsections explain each in turn. One
 * common use for loops is to iterate over the elements of an array. ยง7.6
 * discusses this kind of loop in detail and covers special looping methods
 * defined by the Array class.
