/*
 * As of ES6, the easiest way to loop through each of the elements of an
 * array (or any iterable object) is with the for/of loop
 */

let letters = [..."Hello world"]; // An array of letters
let string = "";
for(let letter of letters) {
    string += letter;
}
string // => "Hello world"; we reassembled the original text

/*
 * The built-in array iterator that the for/of loop uses returns the
 * elements of an array in ascending order. It has no special behavior for
 * sparse arrays and simply returns undefined for any array elements
 * that do not exist.
 * 
 * If you want to use a for/of loop for an array and need to know the
 * index of each array element, use the entries() method of the array,
 * along with destructuring assignment, like this:
 */

let everyother = "";
for(let [index, letter] of letters.entries()) {
    if (index % 2 === 0) everyother += letter; // letters at even indexes
}
everyother // => "Hlowrd"

/*
 * Another good way to iterate arrays is with forEach(). This is not a
 * new form of the for loop, but an array method that offers a functional
 * approach to array iteration. You pass a function to the forEach()
 * method of an array, and forEach() invokes your function once on
 * each element of the array:
 */

let uppercase = "";
letters.forEach(letter => { // Note arrow function syntax here
    uppercase += letter.toUpperCase();
});
uppercase // => "HELLO WORLD"

/*
 * As you would expect, forEach() iterates the array in order, and it
 * actually passes the array index to your function as a second argument,
 * which is occasionally useful. Unlike the for/of loop, the
 * forEach() is aware of sparse arrays and does not invoke your
 * function for elements that are not there.
 *
 * You can also loop through the elements of an array with a good oldfashioned for loop 
 */

let vowels = "";
for(let i = 0; i < letters.length; i++) { // For each index in the array
    let letter = letters[i]; // Get the element at that index
    if (/[aeiou]/.test(letter)) { // Use a regular expression test
        vowels += letter; // If it is a vowel, remember it
    }
}
vowels // => "eoo"

/*
 * In nested loops, or other contexts where performance is critical, you
 * may sometimes see this basic array iteration loop written so that the
 * array length is only looked up once rather than on each iteration. Both
 * of the following for loop forms are idiomatic, though not particularly
 * common, and with modern JavaScript interpreters, it is not at all clear
 * that they have any performance impact:
 */

// Save the array length into a local variable
for(let i = 0, len = letters.length; i < len; i++) {
    // loop body remains the same
}

// Iterate backwards from the end of the array to the start
for(let i = letters.length-1; i >= 0; i--) {
    // loop body remains the same
}

/*
 * These examples assume that the array is dense and that all elements
 * contain valid data. If this is not the case, you should test the array
 * elements before using them. If you want to skip undefined and
 * nonexistent elements, you might write:
 */

for(let i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
    if (a[i] === undefined) continue; // Skip undefined + nonexistent elements
    // loop body here
}
