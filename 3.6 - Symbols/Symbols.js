/*
 * Symbols were introduced in ES6 to serve as non-string property names.
 * To understand Symbols, you need to know that JavaScriptâ€™s
 * fundamental Object type is an unordered collection of properties,
 * where each property has a name and a value. Property names are
 * typically (and until ES6, were exclusively) strings. But in ES6 and
 * later, Symbols can also serve this purpose:
 */

let strname = "string name"; // A string to use as a property name
let symname = Symbol("propname"); // A Symbol to use as a property name
typeof strname // => "string": strname is a string
typeof symname // => "symbol": symname is a symbol
let o = {}; // Create a new object
o[strname] = 1; // Define a property with a string name
o[symname] = 2; // Define a property with a Symbol name
o[strname] // => 1: access the stringnamed property
o[symname] // => 2: access the symbolnamed property

/*
 * The Symbol() function takes an optional string argument and returns
 * a unique Symbol value. If you supply a string argument, that string will
 * be included in the output of the Symbolâ€™s toString() method.
 * Note, however, that calling Symbol() twice with the same string
 * produces two completely different Symbol values.
 */

let s = Symbol("sym_x");
s.toString() // => "Symbol(sym_x)"

/*
 * To serve this latter use case, JavaScript defines a global Symbol
 * registry. The Symbol.for() function takes a string argument and
 * returns a Symbol value that is associated with the string you pass. If no
 * Symbol is already associated with that string, then a new one is created
 * and returned; otherwise, the already existing Symbol is returned. That
 * is, the Symbol.for() function is completely different than the
 * Symbol() function: Symbol() never returns the same value twice,
 * but Symbol.for() always returns the same value when called with
 * the same string. The string passed to Symbol.for() appears in the
 * output of toString() for the returned Symbol, and it can also be
 * retrieved by calling Symbol.keyFor() on the returned Symbol.
 */

let s = Symbol.for("shared");
let t = Symbol.for("shared");
s === t // => true
s.toString() // => "Symbol(shared)"
Symbol.keyFor(t) // => "shared"
