/*
 * The kinds of values that can be
 * represented and manipulated in a programming language are known as
 * types, and one of the most fundamental characteristics of a
 * programming language is the set of types it supports. When a program
 * needs to retain a value for future use, it assigns the value to (or “stores”
 * the value in) a variable. Variables have names, and they allow use of
 * those names in our programs to refer to values. The way that variables
 * work is another fundamental characteristic of any programming
 * language. This chapter explains types, values, and variables in
 * JavaScript. It begins with an overview and some definitions.
