/*
 * A sparse array is one in which the elements do not have contiguous
 * indexes starting at 0. Normally, the length property of an array
 * specifies the number of elements in the array. If the array is sparse, the
 * value of the length property is greater than the number of elements.
 * Sparse arrays can be created with the Array() constructor or simply
 * by assigning to an array index larger than the current array length.
 */

let a = new Array(5); // No elements, but a.length is 5.
a = []; // Create an array with no elements and
length = 0.
a[1000] = 0; // Assignment adds one element but sets length to 1001.

/*
 * Weâ€™ll see later that you can also make an array sparse with the
 * delete operator.
 * 
 * Arrays that are sufficiently sparse are typically implemented in a
 * slower, more memory-efficient way than dense arrays are, and looking
 * up elements in such an array will take about as much time as regular
 * object property lookup.
 * 
 * Note that when you omit a value in an array literal (using repeated
 * commas as in [1,,3]), the resulting array is sparse, and the omitted
 * elements simply do not exist:
 */

let a1 = [,]; // This array has no elements and length 1
let a2 = [undefined]; // This array has one undefined element
0 in a1 // => false: a1 has no element with index 0
0 in a2 // => true: a2 has the undefined value at index 0

/*
 * Understanding sparse arrays is an important part of understanding the
 * true nature of JavaScript arrays. In practice, however, most JavaScript
 * arrays you will work with will not be sparse. And, if you do have to
 * work with a sparse array, your code will probably treat it just as it
 * would treat a nonsparse array with undefined elements.
